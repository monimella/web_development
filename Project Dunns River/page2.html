    <h1>History of St. Thomas</h1>
<br>
<p>
    The parish of St Thomas is located along 
the south eastern coast of Jamaica and is 
bordered by St. Andrew on the western 
end, Portland on the northern end, and the 
Caribbean Sea on the southern end.

</p>
Originally, the name of the parish was St. 
Thomas in the East, and it was so named 
primarily to distinguish it from St. Thomas 
in the Vale (amalgamated to form present 
day St. Catherine). St. Thomas was combined with the old parish of St. David, and is considered 
to be one of the oldest parishes in Jamaica. Its historic legacy dates back to the 15th century as 
some historians have noted that when Columbus arrived he was met by a strong Taino 
presence in the parish; St. Thomas was therefore one of the earliest areas of settlement in 
Jamaica. 

<p>
Origin of the Name
The name “St. Thomas” was derived from two possible governors of Jamaica - Sir Thomas 
Modyford or Thomas Hickman-Lord Windsor. Some historians argue that St. Thomas was so 
called before the arrival of Sir Thomas Modyford, so, Thomas Hickman Lord Windsor is who the 
parish may have been named after in 1662. 
Morant Bay- Capital
Morant Bay is the capital of St. Thomas and was identified as the chief town and shipping port 
in the parish. Shortly after the English occupation in 1655, it was called “Freeman’s Bay”, 
named after Thomas Freeman, who owned a large tract of land there. Initially the town was 
Court House, Bath St. Thomas in the East (1800s)
said to have been first laid out by Peter Ballette, and was called “Petersborough”. It is uncertain 
when exactly the capital finally became known as Morant Bay.
Settlement 
The first set of people to settle in St. Thomas was the Tainos (Arawak) and they were already 
present in the island on Columbus’ arrival. The Spaniards after settling, established cattle 
ranches at “Morante”; this location would later be known as Morant Bay. ‘Ayala’ or Yealoth 
now known as Yallahs was another important town. A year after the island was captured by the 
English, the earliest English settlers included soldiers that were sent to colonize the Morant Bay 
area. Shortly after the conquest and after Cromwell had acquired Jamaica, he set about 
inducing settlers to come to the island. A group of approximately 1600 persons from Nevis,
including Major Luke Stoke (Governor of Nevis), arrived in the parish. Some settlers found it 
difficult to adjust to their new home and they did not survive too long after living there. In a 
couple of months, up to two thirds of the colonists, including Major Stokes and his wife, died of 
fevers. Major Stokes was survived by his children who became quite wealthy and established 
two imposing houses which still stand today - Stokesfield and Stokes Hall.
Maroons
</p>
<p>
Out of all the groups of persons to have settled in the parish of St. Thomas, the chief settlers 
were the Maroons. These maroons were ex slaves who ran away to the mountains and joined 
other bands of maroons who had fled their captors because of ill treatment, and who did not 
want to be enslaved. In the latter years, bands of maroons settled in the mountainous areas of 
St. Thomas and eventually joined with those in Portland, thus forming the ‘Windward 
Maroons’. They set up independent communities, resiliently fought for many years against the 
English and even had some level of success, as the English had to sign a peace treaty between 
themselves and the Maroons. Maroons are still present in today’s society in their respective 
communities in other parishes.
Morant Bay Rebellion
</p>
The history of St. Thomas is most popularly associated with the Morant Bay Rebellion of 1865, 
which changed the way the island of Jamaica was governed; there was a shift from
representative (House of Assembly) to Crown Colony government. At the forefront of the 
rebellion was Paul Bogle, a local Baptist deacon from Stony Gut, who led a group of his people 
to the then capital of Spanish Town, petitioning for an improvement in the people’s condition. 
Their frustrations and concerns were in vain, as no official would see them and this action 
would contribute to the rebellion which took place on October 11, 1865. Many lives were lost in
the suppression of the rebellion and under Martial Law, four hundred and thirty nine were put 
to death; a further one hundred and forty seven were put to death after martial law ceased. 
Under the governance of Edward Eyre, a commission was held to investigate the origins of the 
disturbances. The commission gave Governor Eyre full credit for his promptness in quelling the 
outbreak but held him responsible for the continuance of excessive severity and for the method 
of George William Gordon’s trial and execution. Gordon was a prominent Kingston business 
man and large property owner, who was also the elected member of assembly for St. Thomas. 
Additionally, he was active both politically and religiously and was very critical of Governor Eyre
and his handling of the people and their conditions. George William Gordon along with Paul 
Bogle were declared National Heroes in a ceremony in Morant Bay in 1965
